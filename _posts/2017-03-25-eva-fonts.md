  Both TV and movie fonts included The 1995 TV anime Neon Genesis Evangelion was
  a watershed moment for anime for many reasons. Its visceral depictions of
  combat with nebulous alien foes marked a turn towards harder fare in action,
  the dynamics of Shinji's relationships with his two co-pilots influenced later
  depictions of female leads, and the psychological turmoil evident throughout
  the show had a deep impact on both Japanese creators and audiences.
